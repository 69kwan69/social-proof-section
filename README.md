## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time I combine the CSS Grid and  CSS Flexbox in a project, and it was fun, actually.
Although the page seems not so responsive, I guess taking Mobile-first approach is a much easier way to deal with this kind of project.
